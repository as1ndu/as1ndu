## The current state
There is a lot of hype about what the global distributed ledger aka "Blockcahin" can do for society.
A "trust machine" as some people call it tha will bring power of finance, data sovreigty and inclusion to the people
and hence making centralized intermediaries like Visa, Standard chared, Facebook render them obselete. 

We shall achive this by using  a combination of robust, battel tested cyrptography & game theory.

While these this vision is plausible, realising it is not a easy as it may seem.

The blockchain is not yet ready.


## The core barriers to main stream adoption

The blockchain, while being a new concept in decetralized distributed databeses has also presesnted very unique set of problems in computer science that have never been solved at the time of this writting. 

- Scalability

The current bandwidth, i.e the data that can be transamitted through a blockchain with in a given time is simple too bounded for main stream adoption.

Ethereum for instance does a maximum of 13 transactions per second.  Visa on the other hand can do 24,000 Transaction per second.
So as you can see the blockcahin is thousands of mangitudes unable to manage a global traffic fo financial transactions.

Coming up with a solution to scalability the problems without tarnishing the original value propositions of a blockchain (immutability/security, decentralisation & censorship resistance) is not trivial. It has been nick named the ["scalability trilemma"](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#this-sounds-like-theres-some-kind-of-scalability-trilemma-at-play-what-is-this-trilemma-and-can-we-break-through-it) by Vitalik 


- Intuitive privatekey management 

Ordinary users will simply never wrap theri heads around private keys.

Privatekeys, whikc are a siting of text  used to sign transactions and make other proofs(cryptographic) in order  
for other entities on a blockchain  to verify their identies with out reasonalbe doubt.

Private keys have two main problems first, how to store the securely.  
I memorise, take a picture, or copy  your private key i can literally steal all your money. 

Second, you loose your key you loose acess to all your money & noone ca ever help you out.


We need to first come up with an inutive using ATM/Debit cards.

I magine you if bank told you if you forgot your Debit card PIN you loose acess to all your money with zero hope of recovering it how ever large a sum of money it would be.

If the above was the case, i dont think any one would use debit cards. I there for find it fair to call people that keep significant amounts of cryptocurrency  with under a private key Ultra risk takers.


- Contract safety

I was glad that Rick dudley [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGHAuWz_4U) about this in ETHCC he said "..smart contracts on Ethereum unsafe but secure, while traditional computers are safe but insecure.."



- Privacy

- Price volatility

## Should we just wait?
- a bad morgage
- This is not advice i am not an invets me
