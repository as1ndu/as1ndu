My name is Asindu. This is my blog where I explore assorted  topics around trustless mechanisms, smart-contracts, programming, machine intelligence amongst others.

<!-- 
The blog is called "Synchronising Life & Dreams" because I believe the sole purpose of a humans is to work towards turning their present world (life) in to the world the want (dreams). We should always try to keep our life & dreams in sync, or else we loose a sense of purpose.ðŸ™‚

I am very active on twitter & also keep a repository of notes on interesing papers, talks & experiments, mostly around software.

My programming languages of choice usually revolve around Python,  Nim & Dart. I also write smart-contract code in Scilla, Vyper & Solidty.
As for my  main work, as of late revolves around designing & building dapps that run on Zilliqa.


I also maintain various side projects;

- [Scilla VScode](#) : VScode etension for the scilla smart contact language.
- [Talla](#) : TOTP client for the desktop.
- [Shamin](#) : A Shamir secret sharing client for Windows.
- [Ruth RSS](#) : An RSS reader with autommatic text summarization & text to Speech.
- [Rave](#) : Flutter plugin that supports Mobile Money transactions  via Flutterwave.
- [EQN](#) : A math pre-processor for Eqn notation.
