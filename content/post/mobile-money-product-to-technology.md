Mobile Money is probably the most common narrative in the Ugandan the tech startup space. Unfortunately, the reluctancy of stake holders to upgrade it from a **product** to a **technology**  is a path to which the concept will die before we realise its ultimate potential.

The vision of mobile money that we dream of, is having people send & receive money amongst each other  exclusively using 4 digit PINs and [SIM Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_identity_module) for authentication/identification of users.

The big plus of this design besides the convenience of having a bank in your pocket, is the  better security as attackers need both physical access to the SIM card & Mobile Money PIN to pull off a successful attack & _this provides Mobile Money accounts 2 factor Authentication by design_.

Mobile Money has robust security design that is often over looked, unlike banking web portals where someone only needs to glance at your username & password, so they can comfortably clear out your bank balance from an obscure remote location.

The second benefit of  mobile money's design is that through interfaces like [USSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data) it is possible for people to access
and actively use funds _[without the need of a smart phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJvWm6VAjUE) or an internet connection_.

## From a product to a technology

Mobile Money currently exists as solo spin-off products offered by distinctive telecommunication companies. For instance, MTN has [MTN Mobile Money](https://www.mtn.co.ug/en/mobile-money/Pages/default.aspx), Airtel Has [Airtel Money](https://www.airtel.co.ug/airtel_money) and UTL has [M-Sente](https://www.utl.co.ug/m-sente-6/)

The major limitation of these products is one thing,  _[Vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor%5Flock-in)_.

Each mobile money provider only allows payments to happen within their network. For instance an MTN subscriber(MTN Mobile Money) cannot send money to a UTL subscriber(M-Sente).

This lack of interoperability is a _very unnecessary glass wall_ that kills a lot use cases & leaves us open to
[outrageous regulation](https://medium.com/@stoneatwine/the-death-of-mobile-money-and-financial-inclusion-in-uganda-73609cb340dd) and [rent seekers](https://secure.jpesa.com/en/fees.php) trying to "solve" this problem.

What I mean by upgrading Mobile Money from a **product** to a **technology**  is that stake holders from telecom companies to banks, lawyers, & businesses should form a coalition (Mobile Money Consortium or M2C for short).

>The focus of this coalition is to work on a formal spec analogous to what [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) is for the web, only that M2C will be  tasked with creating formal  specifications on Mobile Money interoperability.

I have come to the opinion that all startups  building products on the currently siloed Mobile Money  products are building a business a sand.

For the current **products** like Airtel Money, M-Sente, MTN Mobile Money, you are limited by what the cooperations think is  _possible and good for them_.

If these **products** are to upgrade to a **technology**, then they need to build work groups & achieve interoperability so entrepreneurs can implement _any_ uncase they can imagine.

If such an initiative is taken seriously, and a large enough number of countries adopt it, Mobile Money has the potential to become the [SWIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication) of mobile payments.  ( _in my context SWIFT & the web is a technology not a product_ )

.. And as a result people like [Hikmet Ersek](https://corporate.westernunion.com/leadership.html) can be successfully put out of the business of stealing money from diasporans.
