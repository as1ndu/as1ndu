Mobile Money is probably the most common narrative in the Ugandan the tech startup space. Unfortunately, the reluctancy of stake holders to upgrade it from a **product** to a **technology**  is a path to which the concept will die before we realise its ultimate potential.

The vision of mobile money that we dream of, is having people send & receive money amongst each other while exclusively using phone numbers, 4 digit PINs, SIM cards for Authentication and identification of users.

The big plus of this design besides the convenience of having a bank in your pocket, is  better security as attackers need both physical access to the SIM card & Mobile Money PIN to pull off a successful attack & _this provides Mobile Money accounts 2 factor Authentication by design_. Mobile Money has robust security design that is often over looked, unlike Banking web portals where someone only needs to glance at your username & password, so they can comfortably clear out your bank balance from an obscure remote location.

The second benefit of  mobile money's design is that through interfaces like [USSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data) it is possible for people to access
and use funds _[without the need of a smart phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJvWm6VAjUE) or an internet connection_.

## From a product to a technology.

Mobile Money currently exists as solo spin-off products offered by distinctive telecommunication companies. For instance, MTN has [MTN Mobile Money](https://www.mtn.co.ug/en/mobile-money/Pages/default.aspx), Airtel Has [Airtel Money](https://www.airtel.co.ug/airtel_money) and UTL has [M-Sente](https://www.utl.co.ug/m-sente-6/)

Why I mean by upgrading mobile money from a product to a technology
