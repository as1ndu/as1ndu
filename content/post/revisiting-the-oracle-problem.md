title : "Revisiting the oracle problem"
description : "For smart-contracts to execute an event (based on a condition whose source in the real world e.g weather) a third party agent known as an                     oracle is often required to relay data from the real world into the contract. At times, aligned incentives may cause these oracles to mishave                 i.e relaying false data into the contract hence causing a mechanism failure. This is decribed as the oracle problem let analyse it indepth."

## This is a draft post.

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. 

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
