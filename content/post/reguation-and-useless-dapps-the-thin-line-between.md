>"I can’t speak for what Satoshi intended, but I sure don’t think it involved bitcoin exchanges that have draconian rules about KYC, AML, passports, freezes on accounts and laws about reporting “suspicious activity” to the local secret police. There’s a real possibility that all the noise about “governance,” “regulation” and “blockchain” will effectively create a surveillance state, a dossier society." - Timothy C. May [^1] 

## New wine & old skins

On the 10th of Feb 2019 the SEC (The United States body responsible for regulating financial instruments) announced its "Our guide to initial coin offerings" I found the documentation to be vague as it contained statements like, _"ICOs, based on specific facts, may be securities offerings, and fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction of enforcing federal securities laws."_ The statement does not proceed to further outline  the "specific facts" that make a token (ICO) a security. [^2]

To me, this looks like a recurring variant of governments saying "It is what we say it is" to leave options 
open so as to play on semantics in case members the "Deep State" needs to pursue its personal interests[^3].
This can also be because I am not a legal expert.

The SEC however, has a "litmus test" used for determining if a financial instrument is security (i.e) if it falls "..under the SEC’s jurisdiction of enforcing federal securities laws." It goes by the name "The Howey Test". _According to the SEC, a financial instrument passes the "Howey Test" if it satisfies all these;_

1. There is a person (investor) investing the financial instrument i.e creation of an "investment contract"
2. The person (investor) expects to profit from investing in this financial instrument i.e "speculation"
3. The profits expected in "2" above are "..derived from the managerial efforts of others.." who are commonly vested in the same financial instrument.[^4]

My problem  with the SEC's approach is not that regulation is bad. My argument is that the financial sector has changed a bit and using 72 year old case (SEC v. Howey Co. case was decided in 1946)[^5] & to solve current regulatory issues in the bleeding edge fintech space with tokens, smart contracts  that work trustlessly on a global scale, is like pouring new wine (10 year old blockchain driven financial instruments) in to old skin (72 year regulation). _Hence a classic remedy to , a disaster_.[^6]


## Introducing Szabo's law

>"The more kinds of decisions there are to argue over, the less functional the institution will be." - Nick Szabo[^7]

One of the interpretations of Szabo's law is, "Do not implement changes to the blockchain protocol unless the changes are required for the purpose of technical maintenance."[^8]

I find Szabo's law valid in the sense that, inviting regulators like the SEC to modify blockchain protocol's so they can be "compliant" with 72 year old case is a mistake.

_Making a blockchain protocol "compliant" means;_

- Banning some entities from using it's features i.e complying with the United States sanction list.[^9]
- Doxing users by requiring them to submit "Know Your Customer Data".
- Being open to state attacks like confiscation [^10]

>The value proposition of blockchains is to work for anyone anywhere _without_ the limitations above, and the ability for blockchains to work like this is called _social scalability_.[^11]

Adding legal compliance to blockchain protocols hurts social scalability & a fair translation of "compliant blockchains" above can as well mean "breaking a blockchain protocol". 

## Useless Dapps

Dapps or Decentralized applications are basically software deployed on blockchains instead of traditional infrastructure like Cloud (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, VPS, Shared hosting). This decision is taken so as to leverage upon the value proposition of the blockchain (financial instruments that work for anyone, anywhere). 

>Dapps that don't scale socially are useless.

Examples of useless Dapps;

USDC by Coinbase is a unit of account on the blockchain that allows US dollar transactions on the blockchain by allowing it to be redeemable to bank wired US dollars. USDC how ever has parameters in the code that allows  confiscations to be made  from any user at any point in time.[^12]

DX.exchange wants to distribute securities (Google, Facebook, Apple & Tesla Stock) via the blockchain. The service however is only available to millionaires[^13] so as to comply with accredited investor rules of the United States. It also  blocks several countries from accessing the service in attempts to comply regulation. [^14]

DutchX from Gnosis claimed to be a decentralized exchange that allows trustlessly swapping of digital assets  via  Dutch Auction.[^15] DutchX however blocked about a dozen countries from accessing its service. [^16]

## Conclusion

Szabo's law is the thin line that separates useful blockchain applications from useless ones.
