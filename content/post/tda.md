Regulation & The Digital Apartheid.

A few months back I got involved in a discussion on reddit that honestly pissed me off.

The context of the discussion was that;

Someone wrote a blogpost about how todo payment processing in with a payment processing company called Flutter Wave & submits it.
A comment went like;
I replied,

It’s really sad that society won’t accept certain  efforts people are making because they are not knighted by a Scillicon Valley entity.

Why the ban? 

The  internet has been evangelized as a platform where entrepreneurs can easily scale up small businesses to a global audience.

X% of global all payments made on the internet are processed by Paypal & Stripe

Let’s look at payments.

Stripe & Paypal claim to be a Global business. Someone might think there is merit to this global business thing since they are internet based & data packets can be sent to & from in any part of the world.

But here is a map of countries that stripe supports. Yes, it's even missing in entire continents (Africa).

One akward thing about this, is that stripe can accept money from cards based in all African countries (with the exception of Sudan & Somalia & Zimbabwe), the plot twist is that if your an African business, you can never accept money through stripe.

Accepting money is even a more complicated process that disbursements. Cause they have to factor in  issues like identity theft, charge backs & other kinds of card fraud. 
But these companies don’t allow people from  these countries to positively benefit. 

App development.

The same issue also plagues the app development industry.

People from  African countries  can buy & make digital subscriptions. 
But not sell, or earn from software they put in the play store.

But I can’t do anything about this, all I can do is go on the HN page & read about  how much money people are making from their side projects.

The problem does not stop here though, did u know that some people can’t install Go packages & Dart packages just because their country does not align with the US export/import laws?

Now, let's talk alternatives.
 
As much as CEOs like Patrick Collison talk “changing the world ”.
When it come to this form of oppression, they all seem to fall in to a state of paralysis where these types of problems persist.
Their fighting spirit is 0 & all they do is conform to the obscure powers that enforce these rules.

The answer is simple, we need censorship resistant infrastructure for finance. Bitcoin was one of these institutions. 

The 2013 sci-fi Elysium, is a dystopian but kind of related to what’s going on here.

If you haven’t watched Elysium, it’s basically a story about two classes of people one of which are run by an institution that does work for the people. 
The other class of people lived on a man made space station called Elysium. Where they had none of the problems the other class faced I.e disease, poverty  plus others.

How Elysium is related to this situation is that we have people like Bruce Scheneir that say Bitcoin is useless.

My message to Mr. Schenier  is that Bitcoin is indeed useful because it provides an alternative financial system that works as a substitute for such cases of oppression.
If you don’t understand how bitcoin is useful, it’s not because bitcoin is useless, but because you live on Elysium.
