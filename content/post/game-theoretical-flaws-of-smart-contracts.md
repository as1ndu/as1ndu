Smart contracts
- what are they
- not how the TheDAO failed 
- not manipulating contract code but just behaving differently from what we supposed to
- formal verification wont save us

Types of failure
- Front running
  - information asymmetry
  - selfish mining
  - dex orders
  
- Collusion
  - vitalik
  - bribery attacks
  - censorship
  
- X% attacks
  - plutocracy

- Lies from oracles

Mechanism design may save us
