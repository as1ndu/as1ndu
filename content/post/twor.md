The Wisdom of rationals

Prediction markets  like Augur are used to bet  on events. 

For instance you can bet on an event like  “It will rain tomorrow”. 

And if it does rain tomorrow, you get a pay off from people that bet “it will not rain tomorrow”.

There are three kinds of people who would bet in such a market.
The pure gambler, this one doesn’t have the necessary meteorological information he is simply betting at random.
The accurate information trader, these traders have information they think points to the fact that it will rain & they are right.
Inaccurate information traders, have information they think points to the fact that it will rain. But they are wrong.

These are the basic assumptions we make in prediction markets.

Another assumption  is that people in these markets will participate rationally.

Rational participation means that, speculators  will always prefer to place bets in which they think they will make money & they will decline from participating in bets where they think they will lose money.

For instance a rational person should not be a pure gambler because they have higher  chances of making  money by betting on information they know at least something about.

The accurate information trader on the other hand will flourish in this market as they will always have the edge in the market & thus making money of clueless gamblers & people signaling wrong information.

Meanwhile people that alway bet on wrong information will go bust or switch to  markets where they do better.

This is what makes prediction makers so resistant to market manipulation, it’s a system in which everyone signaling wrong information subsidizes people with signaling the correct information.

So with time we can in theory end up with a markets where  information is accurately reflected in share prices (since most people that signal wrong information are bust)

It is often mistaken that prediction markets are based on “The wisdom of the crowds”, but they are actually based on the wisdom of the rationals, a system where people don’t talk about what they don’t know.

Prediction markets have several  applications, they can help us form new forms of governance & also  help us find out if will actually rain tomorrow.
