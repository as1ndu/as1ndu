      <description>&amp;ldquo;I can‚Äôt speak for what Satoshi intended, but I sure don‚Äôt think it involved bitcoin exchanges that have draconian rules about KYC, AML, passports, freezes on accounts and laws about reporting ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù to the local secret police. There‚Äôs a real possibility that all the noise about ‚Äúgovernance,‚Äù ‚Äúregulation‚Äù and ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù will effectively create a surveillance state, a dossier society.&amp;rdquo; - Timothy C. May 1
 New wine &amp;amp; old skins On the 10th of Feb 2019 the SEC (The United States body responsible for regulating financial instruments) announced its &amp;ldquo;Our guide to initial coin offerings&amp;rdquo; I found the documentation to be vague as it contained statements like, &amp;ldquo;ICOs, based on specific facts, may be securities offerings, and fall under the SEC‚Äôs jurisdiction of enforcing federal securities laws.</description>

      <description>Mobile Money is probably the most common narrative in the Ugandan the tech startup space. Unfortunately, the reluctancy of stake holders to upgrade it from a product to a technology is a path to which the concept will die before we realise its ultimate potential.
The vision of mobile money that we dream of, is having people send &amp;amp; receive money amongst each other exclusively using 4 digit PINs and SIM Cards for authentication/identification of users.</description>

      <description>The current state There is a lot of hype about what the global distributed ledger aka &amp;ldquo;Blockchain&amp;rdquo; can do for society. A &amp;ldquo;trust machine&amp;rdquo; as some people call it that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people, hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays &amp;amp; Facebook obsolete.
We shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography &amp;amp; game theory.</description>
