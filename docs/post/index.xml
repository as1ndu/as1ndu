      <description>Mobile Money is probably the most common narrative in the Ugandan the tech startup space. Unfortunately, the reluctancy of stake holders to upgrade it from a product to a technology is a path to which the concept will die before we realise its ultimate potential.

      <description>The current state There is a lot of hype about what the global distributed ledger aka &amp;ldquo;Blockchain&amp;rdquo; can do for society. A &amp;ldquo;trust machine&amp;rdquo; as some people call it that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people, hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays &amp;amp; Facebook obsolete.
We shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography &amp;amp; game theory.</description>
