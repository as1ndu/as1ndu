To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</description>

      <title>Why blockchain is not yet working</title>
      <link>https://asindu.drileba.capital/2018/05/why-bockchain-is-not-yet-working/</link>

A &amp;ldquo;trust machine&amp;rdquo; as some people call it that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people, hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays &amp;amp; Facebook obsolete.
We shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography &amp;amp; game theory.</description>
