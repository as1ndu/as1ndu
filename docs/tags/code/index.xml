      <description>Quantification of properties allows us to measure how well a system might perform.
Quantification also allows us to effectively optimize systems, because if we can quantify something, we can know if things are getting better or worse.
In 2017 Balaji S. Srinivasan, described how it’s possible to quantify decentralization of a project based on mining, client usage, Dev commits, exchange volume, liveliness of nodes &amp;amp; ownership of capital by crypto address.</description>

      <description>Atomic swaps &amp;amp; why they work.
An atomic swap is a trust-minimized mechanism that allows transactions to happen across several different chains.
For instance, one could seamlessly convert their BTC to LTC or Convert their Ether to Zcash. All without the need of a centralized exchange like binance.
No need for KYC, expensive fees, emails or Passwords all this occurs in your wallet.
This is the value prop of atomic swaps, and this article is an attempt clarify how they actually work under the hood.</description>

      <description>Clarifying the blockchain proposition.

Blockchain technology though trendy is elusive for some &amp;amp; most inforation out there seems to e repeating words like &amp;ldquo;decentralized&amp;rdquo; a coherent explanation. Even big brains like robin hanson seem to be consusef about what exactly the blockchain proposition is.</description>

      <description>The problem with JavaScript
The biggest problem with JS is that over the years, it&amp;rsquo;s stake holders failed to morph the programming language into one that would make development the modern web easier.
Why do I still need to install a dependency so I can effectively do data binding &amp;amp; routing? Patterns such as these are so frequently used that they should have been simplified the added to the core of the JS syntax.</description>
